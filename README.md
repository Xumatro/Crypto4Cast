## **How to use:**

### TL;DR
- Create an account at [CryptoCompare](https://cryptocompare.com)
- Create an API in your account and copy the API-key
- Paste your API-key in `settings/api_key.txt`
- Create a python3.8 virtual environment and activate it.
- Run `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Edit the `res`- and `req_sym` fields in the `Data` field of `settings/settings.json` for the crypto and FIAT* currency respectively
- Run `$ python main.py -t` to train a network
- Run `$ python main.py -p` to predict price*
- voil√†!

**You can use a non-FIAT currency such as `ETH` or `USDT` as well in `res_sym`, but it is recommended to stick with a trading pair supported by your exchange.*
<br/>**The default prediction mode gives two values, today's and tomorrow's average respectively*

### Dependencies
- matplotlib
- requests
- pandas
- keras
- tensorflow
- silence_tensorflow (*optional*)*

These can be installed manually by running: `$ pip install {dependency}`, or all at once with `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
<br/>Tensorflow does not yet support python 3.9 so it is reccomended to create a python virtual environment with python 3.8.
<br/>This can be done by running `$ python3.8 -m venv {environment name}` on Linux or Mac.
This will create a folder called `{environment name}`, you will need to actvate this environment by running `$ source env/bin/activate` on Linux or Mac.
Once activated you can install dependencies and run the program.

**If you choose not to install silence_tensorflow, you will need to edit 'rnn.py' and remove the first line.
If you choose to install dependencies the automatic way, silence_tensorflow will be installed by default.*
<br/>

### Execution
This project can be ran either in training or prediction mode.

- Prediction mode: `$ python3 main.py -p`
- Training mode: `$ python3 main.py -t`

## **Settings**
 All settings can be changed in `settings/settings.json`
<br/><br/>
 
## `API`
In this field, all API specific settings can be changed

- `base_url` the base url of your API
- `key_file` the file where your API key is saved

It must be noted that if another API is used, the program will likely break. Different API's will likely use different filed names in the returned JSON data, if this is the case, you can manually change the JSON fields in `data.py` and `api.py`, the current field names should be self-explanatory regarding the data they hold. Different API's might also require different authentication schemes, which you would have to implement yourself. If you do not want to go trough the trouble of doing all this, create an account and API at [CryptoCompare](https://cryptocompare.com), and paste your API key into `settings/key.txt`.
<br/><br/>

## `Data`
In this field, all data specific settings can be changed

- `res_sym` is the symbol wou want to receive the price in, example: `EUR`
- `req_sym` is the coin you want to predict, example: `BTC`
- `timeframe` is the number of entries to return
- `granularity` is the lenght of a single entry, example: `day`
- `trim_leading_blank` whether or not to cut leading whitespaces from returned data
- `series_lenght` is the number of entries to group the data in
- `train_test_ratio` is the ratio between the train and test dataset
- `to_predict` is the price value to predict, example: `open`, `close`
- `prediction_len` the lenght of the series to predict, 1 would predict today's `to_predict`
- `save_file` is the filename of the file to save the data to
<br/><br/>

## `Graph`
In this field, all graphing specific settings can be changed

- `DPI` is the PI of the image to be generated
- `save_file` is the filename to save the graph to
- `dark_mode` whether or not to use a dark theme
- `data_lenght` the lenght of the data series to use, use `all` to use the whole series
- `show_grid` whether to draw gridlines in the graph
<br/><br/>

## `RNN`
In this field, all the neural net specific settings can be changed

- `trained_file` is the filename to save the trained model to
- `arch_file` is the filename to save the architecture of the model to
- `loss_function` the function to estimate the loss while training
- `optimizer` the optimizer algorithm to use while training
- `batch_size` is the number of chunks to split the data between for the network
- `epochs` is the number of training cycles

- `layers` array of layers to build the network from
	- `type` the type of neurons layer consists of
	- `units` the number of neurons in this layer
	- `activation` the activation function to use in the neurons
	- `alpha` negative slope coefficient, only usefull when `activation` is `leaky_relu`
	- `return_seq` whether the layer should return a sequence of not
